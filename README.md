# ESP8266
Repo about my projects with ESP8266. Usually unstable, baddly written code without enough comment :D I douzt that you could use any of it. 
If I got something working which can be useful for others I will publish it in an other repo and probably write also a blog post about it here: nomartini-noparty.blogspot.com
